# Gather *Freyja* output for *Covvfit* analysis 

[*Freyja*](https://github.com/andersen-lab/Freyja) is a popular tool for deconvolution of wastewater data.

As *Covvfit* requires a CSV file with information about time and location of different measurements, we need to appropriately structure the outputs provided by *Freyja*.

This can be accomplished with a command line utility:

```bash
covvfit freyja-gather
```
