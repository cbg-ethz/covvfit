# Statistical models

Here, we explain the statistical models used.

The models are composed of two components:

  - The competition dynamics model used to describe the competition between the variants, linking some interpretable parameters $\theta$ (such as the growth advantages) with ideal (unobserved) abundances, $\mu(t)$.
  - The noise model connecting ideal abundances $\mu(t)$ with observed values $y(t)$, which are subject to some noise.
