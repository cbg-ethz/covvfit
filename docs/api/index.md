# API Reference

The package is divided into several modules, corresponding to different utilities.

## Quasimultinomial model

The quasimultinomial noise model, which corresponds to the high-level *Covvfit* utilities.  
The API is available [here](quasimultinomial.md).

**Caution:** There are public functions in this submodule, which are being refactored into other modules.

## Dynamics

The growth models, linking model parameters to outcomes of idealised abundance.
The API is available [here](dynamics.md).


## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing utilities, used to load deconvoluted data into the model and reshape them into appropriate data formats.
The API is available [here](preprocessing.md).


## Plotting

The plotting utilities. 
The API is available [here](plotting.md).

## Numeric

General numerical programming utilities.
The API is available [here](numeric.md).
