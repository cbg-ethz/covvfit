## Deconvolving the data

*Covvfit* takes as an input a data frame containing deconvolved values.

If you use:

  - *LolliPop*, follow [these instructions](running_deconv/lollipop.md) on how to run *LolliPop*. (Note that the smoothing can bias the results, so you may need to deconvolve the data again, if you used smoothing.)
  - *Freyja*, follow [these instructions](running_deconv/freyja.md) to assemble the outputs into a data frame.

However, in this tutorial we will work with example data, which have already been deconvolved and assembled into a suitable data frame.
